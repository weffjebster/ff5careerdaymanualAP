# FF5 Career Day Manual Archipelago Config
Manual configuration implementation of the Final Fantasy V Career Day randomizer.

For use with the Archipelago multi-game multiworld: https://archipelago.gg

**Game**: Final Fantasy V: Career Day (https://ff5cd.com/)

**Checks**: All bosses and Monsters in a Box

**Key Items**: All Key Items in Career Day, plus World Unlocks

**Other Items**: Jobs

**Victory Condition**: Defeat NeoExDeath spot

**Notes**: You will need an IPS patch to unlock all jobs from the start and that is also compatible with the Career Day rando. This one will do: https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6926/
You also will need to ensure that you enable **All Worlds Open, Grant Key Items, and start with 4 Tablets** in the Career Day randomizer settings. Additionally, the location names for the Monsters in a Box will only make sense if you select the **Monster in a Box Key Items** flag. Additionally additionally, 4-job mode will cause all the crystals in the game to be useless items, which may not be very fun.

World 2, World 3, and The Void are unlocked via **Progressive World Unlock**s.
With the above patch, you start with all the jobs, but you cannot use the jobs until you receive them in AP (there are two copies of each job crystal!)

**Access to World 3 is not considered access to the Void.** In a change from Career Day, the Void can indeed have tablets in it, so beware!

To start you generate a seed with the above flags and any other flags you'd like to use, then click the four Starting Jobs in your Manual tracker to see what jobs you get! Turn all of your characters into their respective starting jobs, and away you go!
